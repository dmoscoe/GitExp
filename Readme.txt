Readme

Here's a file I'm creating at 210223 1212. I want to check the status of my files after I add this. Actually I realize that I cloned a repo inside a repo that I created from scratch. Now I have a repo in a repo... I need to get rid of mylibgit. I'll do that now.

I deleted a line here and replaced it with this one. 1236.
I'm adding another line at 1606 through the website.
