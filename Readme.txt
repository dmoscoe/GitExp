Here's a file I'm creating at 210223 1212. I want to check the status of my files after I add this. Actually I realize that I cloned a repo inside a repo that I created from scratch. Now I have a repo in a repo... I need to get rid of mylibgit. I'll do that now.

I deleted a line here and replaced it with this one. 1236.

Merge conflict! I will just keep everything that's here.

I'm adding another line at 1606 through the website.

Changing this file in both locations. Here's my change from the desktop. 1608.

I'm adding another line at 1606 via the website.
