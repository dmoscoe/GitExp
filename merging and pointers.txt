If a commit has two parents, then it is on two branches. What branch will its child be on? The two branches are not equivalent: one branch is merged TO the other. So old-proj-state was merged TO waffles. So the child of the commit with two parents will be the child on waffles, I think. So the pointer to old-proj-state will point... where? That's my question now. Where will be the pointer to old-proj-state?
